## Introduction[üìö](#Coffee-Shop-Sales-Analysis)
### 
In today‚Äôs competitive coffee industry, gaining a deep understanding of customer purchasing behavior is essential for driving sales and enhancing operational efficiency. This project analyzes transaction data from three coffee shop locations in New York City to uncover key patterns, trends, and business opportunities. By transforming raw sales data into an interactive, user-friendly dashboard, the project provides franchise owners with actionable insights to support data-driven decision-making and strategic growth.

## Problem Statement [üìö](#Coffee-Shop-Sales-Analysis)

## Project Goal[üìö](#Coffee-Shop-Sales-Analysis)
The goal of this project is to transform raw transaction data into a clear and interactive dashboard that highlights customer purchasing behavior, sales trends, and product performance across three coffee shop locations in New York City.
